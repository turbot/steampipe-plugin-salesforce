  # For a full list of standard object names, please see https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_list.htm

  # The naming_convention allows users to control the naming format for tables and columns in the plugin. Below are the supported values:
  # api_native - If set to this value, the plugin will use the native format for table names, meaning there will be no "salesforce_" prefix, and the table and column names will remain as they are in Salesforce.
  # snake_case (default) - If the user does not specify any value, the plugin will use snake case for table and column names and table names will have a "salesforce_" prefix.
  # naming_convention = "snake_case"
