# Table: salesforce_asset

Represents an item of commercial value, such as a product sold by your company or a competitor, that a customer has purchased and installed.

If the naming_convention parameter is set to api_native in the config file, then the table and column names will match whatâ€™s in Salesforce. For instance, the query `select id, name from salesforce_asset` would become `select "ID", "Name" from "Asset"`.
