# Table: salesforce_account_contact_role

Represents the role that a Contact plays on an Account.

If the naming_convention parameter is set to api_native in the config file, then the table and column names will match whatâ€™s in Salesforce. For instance, the query `select id, account_id from salesforce_account_contact_role` would become `select "ID", "AccountID" from "AccountContactRole"`.
