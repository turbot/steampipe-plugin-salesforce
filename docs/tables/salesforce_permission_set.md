# Table: salesforce_permission_set

Represents a set of permissions that's used to grant more access to one or more users without changing their profile or reassigning profiles.
PermissionSet has a read-only child relationship with PermissionSetGroup. Permission set contains the aggregated permissions for the group.

**Note**: This table has one field for each permission with the pattern `permissions_permission_name`, e.g., `permissions_edit_task`. If true, users assigned to this permission set have the named permission. The number of fields varies depending on the permissions for the organization and license type.

If the `naming_convention` configuration argument is set to `api_native`, please see [API Native Examples](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/salesforce/tables/salesforce_permission_set#api_native_examples).
