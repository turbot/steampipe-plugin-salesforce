# Table: salesforce_product

Represents a product that org sells.

If the naming_convention parameter is set to api_native in the config file, then the table and column names will match whatâ€™s in Salesforce. For instance, the query `select id, name from salesforce_product` would become `select "ID", "Name" from "Product2"`.

If the `naming_convention` configuration argument is set to `api_native`, please see [API Native Examples](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/salesforce/tables/salesforce_product#api_native_examples).

## Examples

select
  id,

```

### List inactive products

  not "IsActive";
```
