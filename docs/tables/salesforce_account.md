Salesforce Accounts are companies or individuals that are involved in a business relationship. These can include customers, competitors, and partners. Accounts are used to store information such as name, address, and phone numbers, for easy reference.

## Table Usage Guide

The `salesforce_account` table provides insights into Salesforce Accounts. As a Sales or CRM Manager, explore account-specific details through this table, including name, address, and phone numbers. Utilize it to uncover information about accounts, such as those with recent activities, the relationships between accounts, and the verification of account details.
