# Table: salesforce_account

Represents an individual account, which is an organization or person involved with business (such as customers, competitors, and partners).

If the naming_convention parameter is set to api_native in the config file, then the table and column names will match whatâ€™s in Salesforce. For instance, the query `select name, annual_revenue from salesforce_account` would become `select "Name", "AnnualRevenue" from "Account"`.
